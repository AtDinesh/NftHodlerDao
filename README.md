# DAO_onchain

In this project, we want to create a DAO for the holders of a specific NFT collection.

More information about the expected functionalities of the DAO are given in "hardhat".
Beside, a simple front-end is created using Next.js with basic functionalities (connecting a wallet, viewing proposals, creating proposals.)

WARNING: This project is not intended to be used in production. It is only a demo project used for learning. It is not perfect and more functionalities could be added. This project was first intended to familiarize further with Solidity and the creation of smart contracts.
