# DAO_onchain

In this project, we want to create a DAO for the holders of a specific NFT collection.
- Anyone who owns a DAOHodler NFT can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from an NFT marketplace
- All owners of a DAOHodler NFT can vote for or against the active proposals (1 NFT = 1 vote/proposal)
- If majority of the voters vote in favor of the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase happens automatically from the marketplace
- We simulate a fake NFT Marketplace that behaves like a real one.
- A simple website will be built using Next.js to allow users to create/vote for proposals.
